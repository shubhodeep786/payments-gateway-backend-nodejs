# Payments Gateway Backend

This repository demonstrates a basic payment gateway backend written in Node.js using the MVC pattern. It contains a small Auth and Merchant service implemented with Express and Sequelize.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the overall microservices design and database schema.

## Getting Started

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the database URL and JWT secret.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
